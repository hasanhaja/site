## Frontend tools

React will always have a special place in my heart because it was my gateway into the frontend world (and it's still paying the bills, lol). It rightfully brought me out of a world where I was building web applications in Java, and today I happily put up with all the chaos that is the modern frontend. These are my favorite technologies right now:

- Solid
- React
- Tailwind
- Plain ol' HTML and CSS

## Fullstack, serverless & more 

I definitely got thrown in the deep end with these ideas and technologies, but it's really shaped my understand of fullstack web applications and serverless technologies. Even though I started with Next.js (straight from `create-react-app` without a clue in the world of what's even possible), it wasn't until Deno's Fresh and Astro that things really started clicking. This is pretty much the order in which I made that journey:

- 11ty
- Astro
- Deno Deploy
- SolidStart
- Vercel
- AWS CDK
- Next.js

## Programming languages 

I'm quite a programming language geek! I may not be great at many of them, but I absolutely adore them. These are my top favorites:

- TypeScript
- Zig
- Rust
- Kotlin
- Java
- C++

## Podcasts & YouTube Channels

I consume this content virtually every single day:

- JavaScript Jabber
- JSParty
- Syntax FM
- CoRecursive Podcast
- Changelog
- Ryan Carniato's streams and VODs
- Kevin Powells YouTube channel
