  I love the web and I enjoy building web experiences. I spend a lot of my time exploring web technologies and I aim to raise the general awareness of web developers with what the platform has to offer.

  <h2>What I do</h2>
  <p>
    In my day job, I'm building
    <a
      data-accent-theme="nextjs"
      href="https://nextjs.org/"
    >
      Next.js
    </a>
    apps and spend a lot of time advocating for web standards and pushing to improve our performance. As a part of this effort, I've been researching
    <a
      data-accent-theme="solidjs"
      href="https://www.solidjs.com/"
    >Solid</a> as an alternative that has a low barrier of entry for React developers and
    <a
      data-accent-theme="astro"
      href="https://astro.build/"
    >ðŸš€Astro</a> for people who want a fullstack, lightweight and HTML-first framework.
    My current favorite technologies are
    <a
      data-accent-theme="11ty"
      href="https://www.11ty.dev/"
    >ðŸŽˆ11ty</a> and Web Components.

  <h2>How I got here</h2>
  <p>I learned HTML in the Dreamweaver days when I was about 12, but my dad taught it to me using a simple text editor and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>. As a result, I always ended up tinkering with HTML and viewing source on ones that looked far beyond what I knew to build. I never got beyond <code>alert("Hello world!")</code> or even got to put my site on the internet, but it always felt like a place I could belong.</p>
  <p>Years later in school, I learnt a bit of Python and went through a rebellious phase and didn't want to code like my dad. I ended up going to university for mechanical engineering and really enjoyed that. Because of nature of the course, I didn't get access to lathes, milling machines or welding stations outside of coursework, but I'm a tinkerer. I need to play and experiment with things to learn so I started to get bored. Since I had easy access to computers, I naturally gravitated towards learning to code.</p>
  <p>I started with Java so I can get as much help from my dad as possible, but I kept trying to learn how to code on Arudinos so I can marry up my experience with both coding and mechanical engineering. I did end up doing this for a while and brought in more coding into my engineering coursework, but I eventually realized that I just really enjoy coding. I learned a lot about programming paradigms, different languages, and touched on databases. Eventually, I did my masters in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, where I learned a lot of Math, Python and C++.</p>
  <p>In 2020, I started working as a software engineer doing fullstack Java development building web applications, which made it feel like I've come full circle in my programming journey. My tinkering became a lot more focused again, so I delved deeper and immersed myself in as much of the web development community as possible. And this was my introduction to React.</p>

  <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
  <p>I've been playing with all sorts of web technologies with a strong skew towards the frontend. My focus has been understanding technologies well enough so I can pick and suggest the right tool for the job. The kind of sites and apps I build most now are content heavy sites with interactivity, rather than a highly dynamic application with super deep sessions.</p>
